Final Project

Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening Sir Dan,

  As for my final project, I've been watching and reviewing each existing project that can be found on youtube
and so far, there are 3 different projects that I would like to recreate and more likely add or combine them w/
what codes that I know right now or other codes that already existed. The first project is about an Attendance 
System, second project is a calculator, and the third project is a website for our business. I will try to run 
first then decide what can I recreate that will be the main part of my final project.
